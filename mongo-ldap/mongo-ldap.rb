# mongo-ldap.rb -- Utility sync LDAP user roles/permissions into MongoDB
# MongoDB Inc. 2013-2014 -- David Hows
#
# Script Sync Procedure:
#  - Set up connections to MongoDB and LDAP server
#  - Gather the permissions from MongoDB and LDAP
#  - Construct a list of commands to be executed to alter the relevant user permissions
#    - Find all users which exist in MongoDB but not LDAP
#      - These users need to be deleted
#    - Compare all existing users in LDAP and MongoDB
#      - Update permissions on users (if needed) so that both will match
#    - Find all users which exist in LDAP but not MongoDB
#      - These users need to be added
#  - Execute each item in the list of commands against MongoDB to complete the sync
#
# Requires the net/ldap gem and the 1.10 release of the Mongo gem
#
# Usage:
#  ruby mongo-ldap.rb <mongodb URI> <ldap URI>
#
# Permissions needed:
#  The MongoDB URI needs to have permissions that will allow it to modify user permissions on any
#  database (normally userAdminAnyDatabase)
#  The LDAP URI needs to have permissions such that all of the MongoDB users can be read successfully
#
# LDAP Setup:
#  This script works by navigating to the specified MongoDB organizational unit (ou)
#  From here it expects one ou for database that is being managed. Within these database
#  entries there should be one organisational role cn for each permission needed
#  These cn's should be populated with roleOccuptants which are the UID of people granted
#  this given permission on a given database.
#
#  For an example of this setup please see the "example.ldif" file within this repository.
