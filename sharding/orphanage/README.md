orphanage.js
------------

## This script is provided for historical reference only

MongoDB 2.6 adds the cleanupOrphaned command which should always be preferred to this script. Deleting orphans with this script should only be used on MongoDB versions prior to 2.6 Additionally in MongoDB 4.4, orphans are less likely to be created due to the improved resilience of the deletion process.

### Description

orphanage.js is a utility to find and remove orphaned documents.

### Usage

 - sh.stopBalancer()               -- Stop the balancer
 - Orphans.setOutputNS('test.orphan_output') -- Save badChunks to a collection and suppress output
 - Orphans.preFlight()             -- Make connections ahead of time to prevent screen clutter during find/findAll type commands
 - Orphans.find('database.collection') -- Find orphans in a given namespace
 - Orphans.findAll()               -- Find orphans in all namespaces
 - Orphans.remove()                -- Removes the next chunk
