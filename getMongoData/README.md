getMongoData.js
---------------

### Description

`getMongoData.js` is a utility to gather MongoDB configuration and schema information.
See [getMongoData.log](sample/getMongoData.log) for sample output.


### Usage

To execute on a locally running `mongod` on default port (27017) without authentication, run:

    mongo --quiet --norc getMongoData.js > getMongoData.log

To execute on a remote `mongod` or `mongos` with authentication, run:

    mongo HOST:PORT/admin -u ADMIN_USER -p ADMIN_PASSWORD --quiet --norc getMongoData.js > getMongoData.log

If `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is omitted, the shell will prompt for the password.

To have the output be in a JSON format, modify the above commands to include the following eval argument,
as demonstrated for the local execution:

    mongo --quiet --norc --eval "var _printJSON=true; var _ref = 'CS-XXXXX'" getMongoData.js > getMongoData-output.json

By default, the outut will include a sample document from each non-system collection.  To disable this, include `_excludeDocs` argument as shown below:

    mongo --quiet --norc --eval "var _printJSON=true; var _excludeDocs=true" getMongoData.js > getMongoData-output.json
