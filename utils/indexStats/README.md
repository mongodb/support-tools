indexStats.js (beta)
------------

### Description

indexStats.js is a utility that will collect index usage statistics for a MongoDB collection cross-cluster and provide aggregated results. It can be used to help determine whether there are unused/little used indexes that can be dropped.

The statistics provided by this utility SHOULD NOT be the sole means used for making a decision to drop an index. Any sample taken contains statstics for that time period only and may not reflect subsequent query traffic.

Please make sure to validate any changes in a non-production environment before executing on them.

NOTE: Index usage statistics are only available in MongoDB versions 3.2 and later.

### Usage

Run indexStats.js via mongo shell and follow directions given.
 - mongo --shell indexStats.js
