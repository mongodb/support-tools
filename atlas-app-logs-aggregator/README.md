# MongoDB Atlas Logs Fetcher

This tool is a Python script designed to fetch logs from a MongoDB Atlas App Services application using pagination. It supports optional date range filtering and provides a way to authenticate using MongoDB Atlas API keys.

## Features

- Fetch logs from MongoDB Atlas App Services application.
- Supports pagination to handle large sets of logs.
- Optional date range filtering using `start_date` and `end_date` parameters.
- Validates date inputs to ensure they follow the ISO 8601 format.
- Authenticates using MongoDB Atlas public and private API keys.
- Optional `user_id` for user id filtering logs.
- Optional `co_id` for correlation id filtering logs.
- Fetch only error logs using the `errors_only` option.
- Filter logs by key-value pairs using the `--filter` option.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- `requirements.txt` library dependencies.

## Installation

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

- `project_id` (**required**): The Atlas Project ID (hexadecimal string).
app_id (**required**): The App ID (string).
- `public_api_key` (**required**): The Atlas Public API Key (string).
- `private_api_key` (**required**): The Atlas Private API Key (string with hyphens).
- `--start_date` (optional): Start Date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ).
- `--end_date` (optional): End Date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMZ).
- `--type` (optional): Comma-separated list of supported log types. Currently, the types available are: `TRIGGER_FAILURE, TRIGGER_ERROR_HANDLER, DB_TRIGGER, AUTH_TRIGGER, SCHEDULED_TRIGGER, FUNCTION, SERVICE_FUNCTION, STREAM_FUNCTION, SERVICE_STREAM_FUNCTION, AUTH, WEBHOOK, ENDPOINT, PUSH, API, API_KEY, GRAPHQL, SYNC_CONNECTION_START, SYNC_CONNECTION_END, SYNC_SESSION_START, SYNC_SESSION_END, SYNC_CLIENT_WRITE, SYNC_ERROR, SYNC_OTHER, SCHEMA_ADDITIVE_CHANGE, SCHEMA_GENERATION, SCHEMA_VALIDATION, LOG_FORWARDER`
- `--user_id` (optional): Return only log messages associated with the given user_id.
- `--co_id` (optional): Return only log messages associated with the given request Correlation ID.
- `--filter` (optional): Filter logs by key-value pairs (e.g., `--filter event_subscription_name=<trigger_name>,function_name=<function_name>`).
- `--errors_only` (optional): Return only error log messages.
- `--verbose` (optional): Enable verbose logging information.

### Example

```bash
python main.py <project_id> <app_id> <public_api_key> <private_api_key> --start_date 2024-10-05T14:30:00.000Z --end_date 2024-10-06T14:30:00.000Z --type TRIGGER_FAILURE,SCHEMA_GENERATION
```

With optional parameters

```bash
python main.py <project_id> <app_id> <public_api_key> <private_api_key> --start_date 2024-10-05T14:30:00.000Z --type TRIGGER_FAILURE,SCHEMA_GENERATION --user_id 671d2e2010733ecbaa2bab8f --filter event_subscription_name=getUnpausedClustersMetrics
```

If `start_date` and `end_date` are not provided, the script will default `start_date` to the last 24 hours from the current time.

## Â Filtering Logs

The `--filter` option allows you to filter logs by key-value pairs. This option accepts multiple key-value pairs separated by spaces. Each key-value pair should be in the format key=value.

The `key-value` pair must be the values returned by the endpoint. This way it will use them to filter and only keep those that match. For example, for a `"type": "SCHEDULED_TRIGGER"`, the response key-values will be similar to:

```json
{
  "_id": "671d2e2010733ecbaa2bab8f",
  "co_id": "671d2e2010733ecbaa2bab8d",
  "type": "SCHEDULED_TRIGGER",
  "domain_id": "65b0fc719629ac8e4d8e8774",
  "app_id": "65b0fc719629ac8e4d8e8773",
  "group_id": "658d46ca7605526eb45222a4",
  "request_url": "",
  "request_method": "",
  "started": "2024-10-26T18:00:00.041Z",
  "completed": "2024-10-26T18:00:04.124Z",
  "function_id": "65f31f9f3bfc77348cb1e2e7",
  "function_name": "getOrgClustersProjects",
  "error": "FunctionError: Cannot access member 'db' of undefined",
  "event_subscription_id": "65f335c53d26a2b1ba5d7ba2",
  "event_subscription_name": "getUnpausedClustersMetrics",
  "messages": [
      "reading projects for page: 1",
      "hay m\u00e1s p\u00e1ginas",
      "reading projects for page: 2",
      "fin"
  ],
  "mem_time_usage": 4081000000
}
```

We can use any of this in the `--filter` option (e.g., `--filter event_subscription_name=getUnpausedClustersMetrics`)

## Logging

The script supports logging to both the console and a log file. By default, log files are stored in the logs folder. The log file name includes a timestamp to ensure uniqueness for each run.

`--verbose`: When this flag is used, the log level is set to `DEBUG`, providing detailed logging information. Without this flag, the log level is set to `INFO`.

### Log File Location

Log files are stored in the logs folder. Each log file is named with a timestamp to ensure that logs from different runs do not overwrite each other.

### Example Log File Name

```bash
logs/app_20241005_143000.log
```

## Benefits

- **Automated Log Retrieval**: Easily fetch logs from MongoDB Atlas App Services without manual intervention.
- **Date Range Filtering**: Filter logs by date range to focus on specific periods.
- **Pagination Support**: Handle large sets of logs efficiently using pagination.
- **Validation**: Ensure date inputs are in the correct format to avoid errors.
